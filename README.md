===============

These are my efforts in combining a bunch of scripts I have at various sites
into something I can share with the community.

Background
----------

I have various hostname lookup tools I use for incident response.  Each is 
tailored heavily for the environment I run it in.  Why not combine them into
an awesome common framework?  This is my attempt.
